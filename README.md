# DATA ANALYSIS PORTFOLIO PROJECT ON CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION

## SHOPPING CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION - Unsupervised Machine Learning Project

Segmentation is a great way to identify marketing groups from a larger population.

### Problem Statement
Understand the Target Customers for the marketing team to plan a strategy.

### Context
Your boss wants you to identify the most important shopping groups based on income, age, and the mall shopping score. He wants the ideal number of groups with a label for each.

## Objective Market Segmentation

Divide your mall target market into approachable groups. Create subsets of a market based on demographics and behavioral criteria to better understand the target for marketing activities.

## The Approach

1. Perform some quick EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
2. Use KMEANS Clustering Algorithm to create our segments
3. Use Summary Statistics on the clusters
4. Visualize the results

## Requirements

1. Standard Python Installation
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. PowerPoint (for any presentations or visual summaries)

## Analysis

### Target Cluster

- **Target group**: Cluster 1, which has a high Spending Score and high income.
- **Key insights**:
  - 60% of Cluster 1 shoppers are women. A marketing campaign targeting popular items in this cluster could attract these customers.
  - Cluster 2 presents an opportunity to market to customers during sales events on popular items.
