# Data Analysis #1: Understanding the IT Field Related to Data

## Overview

This project explores various fields within IT related to data, such as:
- Data Analysis
- Data Science
- Database Development
- Database Administration
- Database Architecture
- Data Engineering
- Data Warehousing

The goal of this analysis is to investigate the software tools, programming languages, and career paths in these fields, as well as understand the trajectories of individuals in these roles. Insights will be provided based on:
- Salary
- Work-life balance
- Work environment
- Benefits

We will classify individuals by gender, age, and country/region to help prospective employees make informed career decisions.

## Goal

The main objective of this project is to clean and prepare data from Excel or other sources in Power BI using the Power Query Editor. This involves:
- Transforming unclean data into properly formatted data
- Addressing issues such as errors, gaps, spaces, repetitions, and duplicates
- Merging tables where necessary, identifying one-to-one or one-to-many relationships based on column IDs or similar columns

## Challenges

### 1. Multiple Entries in Fields
Columns such as programming languages often contain multiple entries (e.g., "Python, SQL") instead of a single value. Similarly, job roles may list multiple roles/skills (e.g., "Data Analyst, Data Engineer"). This requires a method to handle and separate these multiple values.

### 2. Inconsistent Naming
Variations in job titles (e.g., "Database Eng" vs. "Database Engineer") lead to inconsistencies that need to be standardized or separated for accurate analysis.

## Solution

- Use a comma delimiter to separate multiple entries within the same cell.
- Ignore repeated entries to ensure clean, standardized data that is ready for further analysis.

## Tools Used

- Excel
- Power BI
- Power Query Editor
